# Senior Project, Embedded System Design

In this embedded system design project, I have created a custom STM32 board capable of interfacing with GPIO inputs to retrieve data from an OBD2 scanner. The collected data is then processed. I have implemented the I2C communication protocol to transmit this processed information to SSD1306 displays. Specifically, the system provides real-time display of critical vehicle parameters such as speed and absolute throttle position on these OLED displays.
